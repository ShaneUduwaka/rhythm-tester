# Rhythm Tester

A Python command-line application that tests your rhythm accuracy and timing consistency. The program challenges users to maintain a consistent rhythm and provides detailed performance analysis.

## Features

* Interactive rhythm timing test
* Adjustable rhythm speed (1, 2, or 3 seconds)
* Custom number of rounds (5 to 50)
* Measures timing accuracy for each round
* Provides performance ratings such as:

  * Spot on
  * Great
  * Okay
  * Miss
* Displays detailed statistics including:

  * Fastest response
  * Average response
  * Slowest response
  * Per-round timing differences
* Option to replay multiple sessions

## Requirements

* Python 3.x

## How to Run

1. Open Command Prompt or Terminal
2. Navigate to the project folder
3. Run the program:

```
python RhyTest.py
```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the rhythm test

## Example Use Case

This program can be used to:

* Test timing consistency
* Improve rhythm accuracy
* Practice reaction timing
* Demonstrate Python timing and input handling

## Project Purpose

This project demonstrates the use of Python for interactive command-line applications, timing measurement, input validation, and performance analysis.
